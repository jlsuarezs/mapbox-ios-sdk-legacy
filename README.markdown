Mapbox iOS SDK
--------------

**This tree of the Mapbox iOS SDK is deprecated in favor of the [Mapbox GL](http://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native)-based version 2.0.0 and above. The future of Mapbox maps is vector rendering, and 2.0.0 is a rewrite based on OpenGL ES and vector rendering.  Unlimited, per-user Mapbox pricing plans cannot be used with this version of the iOS SDK.**

See [this doc](README-old.markdown) for the original project details.
